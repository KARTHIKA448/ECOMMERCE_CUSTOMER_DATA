**Customer Behavior Analysis Using Python**

Customer Behavior Analysis involves examining and understanding how customers interact with a business, product, or service. This analysis enables organizations to make informed decisions, tailor their strategies, and enhance customer experiences. This project leverages a dataset to explore various aspects of customer behavior on an e-commerce platform.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this analysis is ecommerce_customer_data.csv. It provides information about different users and their behavior on an e-commerce website, including demographic details and platform usage.

**Objectives**
- Analyze customer demographics and behavior patterns.
- Identify key trends and insights related to platform usage.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving customer engagement and experience.
  
**Key Findings**
